\usage{
af_rr_logistic(model, df, y_name, x_list, digits)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{(glm) A fitted binary logistic regression model object}

\item{df}{(data.frame) The data frame used to fit the model}

\item{y_name}{(character) The name of the dependent variable}

\item{x_list}{(character vector or named vector) List of independent variable names, optionally with categorical level specifications}

\item{digits}{(numeric) Number of digits for rounding numeric output}
}
\value{
(character) HTML-formatted text describing the logistic regression results, including model fit statistics and percentage effects on odds ratios
}
\description{
Generates interpretation text for binary logistic regression results. Creates narrative
descriptions of model fit statistics, including chi-square test, log-likelihood, and pseudo
R-squared, along with effects of significant predictors on the odds of the outcome. Expresses
effects as percentage changes in odds. Returns HTML-formatted text.
