\title{Check if R code is running within an RMarkdown document}
\usage{
af_is_in_rmd()
}
\value{
Logical value: TRUE if running in RMarkdown, FALSE otherwise
}
\description{
This function determines whether the current R code is being executed
within an RMarkdown document during knitting/rendering, as opposed to
running in the R console or as a standalone script.
}
\details{
The function checks the 'knitr.in.progress' option which is set to TRUE
when knitr is actively processing RMarkdown chunks. This provides a reliable
way to detect the execution context and can be useful for conditional
behavior such as adjusting plot output, formatting, or display options
based on whether code is running interactively or in a document.

if (af_is_in_rmd()) {

# Use in conditional plotting
