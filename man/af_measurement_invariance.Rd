\title{Test Measurement Invariance Across Groups}
\usage{
af_measurement_invariance(model, df, group, var_list, latent_var_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{(character or lavaan model) The CFA model specification}

\item{df}{(data.frame) The data frame containing the variables for the analysis}

\item{group}{(character) The name of the grouping variable for multi-group analysis}

\item{var_list}{(character vector) The list of observed variables to include in the CFA}

\item{latent_var_name}{(character) The name of the latent variable}
}
\value{
(list) A named list containing: fits (list of four CFA model results), measEqOut (semTools comparison object), result_text (interpretation text), plots (list of ggplot objects for latent comparison and difference plots), and differences (list of difference statistics and correlations between models)
}
\description{
Conducts a comprehensive measurement invariance analysis by fitting and comparing four
levels of confirmatory factor analysis models: configural, metric, scalar, and strict.
Generates comparison plots, calculates differences between latent predictions, and provides
interpretation of the invariance results across specified groups.
