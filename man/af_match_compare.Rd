\title{Compare Treatment Effects With and Without Matching Across Groups}
\usage{
af_match_compare(
  df,
  dep_list,
  ctrl_vars,
  treat_var,
  treat_level,
  group_var,
  group_list
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{(data.frame) The data frame containing all variables for the analysis}

\item{dep_list}{(character vector) List of dependent variable names to analyze}

\item{ctrl_vars}{(character vector) List of control variable names to include in models}

\item{treat_var}{(character) The name of the treatment variable}

\item{treat_level}{(character) The level of the treatment variable to analyze}

\item{group_var}{(character) The name of the grouping variable for stratified analysis}

\item{group_list}{(vector) List of group values to analyze separately}
}
\value{
(list) A named list with two elements: df (data frame containing estimates, p-values, confidence intervals, and significance stars for all models) and plot (ggplot object comparing matched and unmatched treatment effects across groups and outcomes)
}
\description{
Performs comparative analysis of treatment effects across multiple groups or waves,
with and without propensity score matching. For each group, estimates treatment effects
on multiple dependent variables using linear regression with specified covariates, then
performs full matching and re-estimates effects. Returns detailed results and visualization.
