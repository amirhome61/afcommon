\title{Extract Variable Order from Stargazer Output}
\usage{
af_get_stargazer_order(df, models)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{(data.frame) The data frame used in the regression models (not directly used but included for consistency)}

\item{models}{(model object or list) A single fitted model or list of models to pass to stargazer}
}
\value{
(character vector) An unnamed character vector containing coefficient names in the order they appear in stargazer output
}
\description{
Extracts the ordering of coefficient names from stargazer regression table output.
Captures stargazer text output, filters for variable lines (excluding statistics and
notes), and parses the coefficient names in their display order. Useful for creating
consistent variable ordering across different table formats.
