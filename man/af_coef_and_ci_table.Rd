\title{Create Coefficient and Confidence Interval Table}
\usage{
af_coef_and_ci_table(models, cov_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{(list) A named list of fitted model objects}

\item{cov_name}{(character) The name of the covariate to extract from all models}
}
\value{
(data.frame) A data frame with columns: model_name, cov_name, coef, conf1, and conf2
}
\description{
Extracts coefficients and confidence intervals for a specified covariate across
multiple fitted models. Iterates through a list of models and compiles results into
a data frame with one row per model, including model name, covariate name, coefficient,
and confidence interval bounds.
