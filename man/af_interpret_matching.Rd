\item{outcome_name}{(character) The name of the outcome variable. Default is NULL}

\item{treatment_name}{(character) The name of the treatment variable. Default is NULL}

\item{n_units}{(numeric) The number of units included in the analysis. Default is NULL}

\item{max_smd}{(numeric) The maximum standardized mean difference achieved after matching. Default is NULL}

}
\value{
(character) A formatted interpretation text describing the matching analysis, balance assessment, estimation method, and treatment effect results with statistical significance
}
\description{
Generates a comprehensive interpretation text for propensity score matching analysis
results. Creates a narrative report describing the matching method, balance assessment,
treatment effect estimation, and statistical inference, formatted for inclusion in
research reports or manuscripts.
